/* There used to be a DRAG_PUSH_MAX_SPEED here: a 600 px/s ceiling on the
 * VELOCITY handed to Box2D for a window being dragged, meant to stop a fast
 * shove launching its neighbour onto the next desktop. It did that, and it also
 * broke collision outright above 600 px/s of mouse movement — which is an
 * ordinary mouse movement.
 *
 * The reason is worth keeping. A dragged body is kinematic: its TRANSFORM is
 * teleported to wherever the cursor put it, 33px in one step at 2000 px/s, while
 * its velocity said 600. The solver believed the velocity, so it predicted a
 * contact that was already 30px deep, and pushed the other window out slower
 * than the dragged one advanced. Measured: the overlap grew monotonically to
 * 295px — three quarters of a 400px window — and the dragged window came out the
 * far side. Worse, the faster you dragged the LESS the other window was pushed
 * (591 px/s at a 600 px/s drag, 98 px/s at 12000), because the lie got bigger.
 *
 * Box2D now gets the true velocity, so nothing tunnels, and the launch it would
 * otherwise hand over is bounded on the OUTCOME instead: no dynamic body may
 * exceed [physics] max_throw_speed after a step (physics.c). That keeps the
 * property the old ceiling was really after — a shove can never outrun the
 * hardest deliberate throw — without lying to the solver to get it. */
/* How far anything the mouse is carrying may advance in one SOLVER step before
 * physics_step splits the tick into substeps (px, and how many are allowed).
 *
 * The honest velocity above bought collision back up to about 3000 px/s of hand
 * movement, and no further: a drag is a teleport with a velocity attached, so at
 * 6000 px/s the window arrives 100px inside its neighbour and the solver's first
 * sight of the contact is already that deep. Push speed is finite, the window
 * keeps arriving, and the overlap runs away — measured 269px through a 300px
 * window at 6000 px/s and above, which is a flick across one screen in a third
 * of a second and something any hand can do.
 *
 * Substepping is the fix the report asked for: the tick is cut into pieces small
 * enough that the drag enters a contact rather than materialising inside it, so
 * every step the solver sees is one it can still resolve. 32px is a quarter of
 * the narrowest window anyone runs and an eighth of an ordinary one, and the
 * ceiling of 16 bounds the cost of a hand nothing can keep up with (past ~30000
 * px/s the pieces grow again — see docs/physics.md). */

 * its travel inside one tick: 137px in 1/60s is 8200 px/s, which pinned a
 * window against the ceiling and held it there.
 *
 * A single kick at this speed only lifts v²/2g ≈ 30px, which looks far too
 * timid on paper — but a window spans dozens of bands that peak at different
 * moments, so it gets struck again on the way down and pumped like a ball on a
 * paddle. Real music through this reaches ~90px; the 400 that one kick's worth
 * of arithmetic suggested measured 232px and put the window off the top of the
